PROBLEM:

-> any one who is logedin in the app can attempt the quiz 
-> all the question have timer and they will start as soon as the user start the quiz 
    sol: their must a single question in the page and when user click on next question must be open and then the next zuestion timer must start

-> if the time over then next question will open automatically    

->now i can render all the question with ui problem is:-
    -no question marks are shown instead correct or incorrect answer are shown
    -also timer must start after 1 sec of fetching of quesstion
    -no oanswers were saved in data base its all in frontend
    -user can copy or move to previous page
    -user can work without full screen
    -In the instruction page their must be action like do full page etc.
