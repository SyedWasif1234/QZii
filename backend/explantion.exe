**LEARNED NEW THING - 
     db.$transaction - in Prisma ensures that a series of database operations are executed as a single, atomic unit.

    This means it follows an "all or nothing" principle:
    ✅ If all operations within the transaction succeed, their changes are permanently saved to the database (a commit).
    ❌ If even one operation fails, all previous operations within that transaction are undone (a rollback), and the database is left in the state it was in before the transaction started.

    This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency.

    Why It's Important
    
    Imagine a bank transfer where you need to perform two actions:
    Subtract money from Account A.
    Add the same amount to Account B.
    If you run these as separate operations and the second one fails, you've just deleted money from the system. A transaction wraps both operations, guaranteeing that Account B is credited if and only if Account A was successfully debited.
